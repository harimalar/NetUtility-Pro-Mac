Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 21, 2026

NetUtility Pro (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides the NetUtility Pro for macOS application (the “App”). This Privacy Policy describes how information is processed when you use the App.

By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

⸻

1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the NetUtility Pro macOS application and data processed locally on your device through your use of the App.

The App is a locally executed network utility and diagnostic tool. It does not operate as a cloud service.

⸻

2. Data Processed by the App

The App processes operational and diagnostic data that you intentionally input or generate, including but not limited to:
	•	Hostnames, IP addresses, URLs, ports, DNS record selections, and command arguments
	•	Diagnostic outputs such as DNS responses, ping/traceroute results, HTTP probe metadata, route checks, and monitoring results
	•	Optional profile metadata you create (e.g., environment labels, team labels, saved targets, runbook names)

All such data is processed locally on your device unless you explicitly configure integrations that transmit data externally.

⸻

3. Secrets and Credentials

The App does not require credentials to function.

If you choose to store credentials, tokens, or secrets:
	•	They are stored locally on your Mac.
	•	Where applicable, storage uses macOS Keychain services and/or local application storage under your user account.
	•	You are solely responsible for managing, securing, rotating, and deleting any stored secrets.

We do not have access to your saved credentials.

⸻

4. No Tracking or Advertising

The App:
	•	Does not include third-party advertising SDKs
	•	Does not use analytics tracking frameworks
	•	Does not collect advertising identifiers
	•	Does not engage in cross-app tracking
	•	Does not build user profiles for advertising purposes

⸻

5. Network Activity

The App performs network requests only when initiated or configured by you for diagnostic, monitoring, or integration purposes.

Any data transmitted externally occurs solely as a result of:
	•	Targets you specify
	•	Endpoints you configure
	•	Monitoring routes or webhook destinations you enable

You are solely responsible for ensuring that you have authorization to scan, monitor, or probe any network or system using the App.

⸻

6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell personal information.

The App does not automatically transmit your diagnostic data to us or to third parties.

If you configure integrations (such as webhooks, APIs, or monitoring endpoints), data may be transmitted to those third-party services under your direction. We are not responsible for the privacy, security, or data practices of any third-party services you configure.

⸻

7. Local Storage and Retention

Data generated or saved within the App is stored locally on your Mac until you:
	•	Delete it within the App
	•	Remove it manually
	•	Uninstall the App

We do not control retention of exported files or logs you create.

⸻

8. Security

The App implements reasonable technical safeguards, which may include:
	•	macOS Keychain-backed secret storage
	•	Signed policy-pack validation workflows
	•	Local access controls
	•	Audit logging features

However, no software can guarantee absolute security. You acknowledge that you are responsible for securing your device, user account, and operational environment.

⸻

9. User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for:
	•	Ensuring lawful use of the App
	•	Obtaining authorization before scanning, probing, or monitoring any system
	•	Complying with applicable local, national, and international laws
	•	Configuring the App in accordance with your organization’s security and compliance requirements

The App is intended for professional and operational use.

⸻

10. Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to:
	•	Fitness for a particular purpose
	•	Merchantability
	•	Non-infringement
	•	Accuracy or reliability of diagnostic results

We do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or secure operation of the App.

	•	Unauthorized access to systems
	•	Data loss or corruption
	•	Business interruption

⸻

13. International and Regulatory Use

If you use the App in regulated environments (including but not limited to GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, or similar frameworks), you are responsible for ensuring your configuration and use of the App complies with applicable regulatory obligations.
