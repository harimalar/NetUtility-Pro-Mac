<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>

<p>NetUtility Pro ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") provides the NetUtility Pro macOS application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy describes how information is processed when you use the App.</p>

<p>By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Scope</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the NetUtility Pro macOS application and data processed locally on your device through your use of the App.</p>
<p>The App is a locally executed network utility and diagnostic tool. It does not operate as a cloud service.</p>

<h2>2. Data Processed by the App</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hostnames, IP addresses, URLs, ports, DNS record selections, and command arguments</li>
<li>Diagnostic outputs such as DNS responses, ping/traceroute results, HTTP probe metadata, route checks, and monitoring results</li>
<li>Optional profile metadata (environment labels, saved targets, runbook names)</li>
</ul>
<p>All such data is processed locally unless you explicitly configure integrations that transmit data externally.</p>

<h2>3. Secrets and Credentials</h2>
<p>The App does not require credentials to function.</p>
<p>If you choose to store credentials or secrets:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are stored locally on your Mac</li>
<li>Storage may use macOS Keychain services</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for managing and securing stored secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have access to your credentials.</p>

<h2>4. No Tracking or Advertising</h2>
<ul>
<li>No advertising SDKs</li>
<li>No analytics frameworks</li>
<li>No advertising identifiers</li>
<li>No cross-app tracking</li>
<li>No user profiling for advertising</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Network Activity</h2>
<p>The App performs network requests only when initiated or configured by you. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have authorization to scan, probe, or monitor any network or system.</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal information. The App does not automatically transmit your diagnostic data to us. Data may be transmitted only to endpoints you explicitly configure.</p>

<h2>7. Local Storage and Retention</h2>
<p>All generated or saved data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>The App implements reasonable safeguards such as Keychain-backed storage and local access controls. However, no software can guarantee absolute security.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under 13 and is intended for professional or enterprise users.</p>

<h2>10. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
